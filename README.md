#EMCSorter
For all your 1.7.10 EMC-filtering needs.
---------------------------------
Adds a chest to ProjectE that, when connected to most item transport solutions (ie pipes), will only accept items with a valid EMC value.
Stupid-simple mod and I'm sure there's some transport method that will bypass the check.  Your mileage my vary.

Currently crafted by combining an Alchemical Chest with sugar.

Should be fairly stable against changes to ProjectE.  Haven't tested how far back compatibility goes but any release from 1.7.10 should be good.
